# ChatBot-NLTK
This is the ChatBot created using NLTK and Neural Network, her name is Luna

I made this ChatBot based in a YouTube tutorial "Tech With Tim". You can access his chanel in this link "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4JX40jDee_tINbkjycV4Sg".

After completing his tutorial I made some minor changes on the code, I change the ChatBot language to PT-BR, so some Librarys are a little bit different from the tutorial. Also, I comment the code in PT-BR.

All the data you need to run the ChatBot you can find in the repository.

The version from the librarys and the Python are:

Python = 3.6.12
nltk = 3.5
tensorflow = 2.4.0
numpy = 1.19.3
tflearn = 0.5.0


Holpe this help you.
